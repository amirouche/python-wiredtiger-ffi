Kesako wiredtiger ?
-------------------

At the very core, it's a configurable ordered key/value store, column aware,
with global transactions.

wiredtiger is a versatile database built by the engineers who created
Oracle Berkeley Database (formely known as Sleepycat Database and bsddb).

It can provide a performance boost for your application but also simplify
its design by using a schema that is simpler than the one you would use
with SQLite.
